# 🍽️ MealBridge

## AI-Powered Food Rescue Platform

MealBridge is an AI-powered web application developed for the **AI for Good Hackathon 2026**. The platform connects restaurants with NGOs to reduce food waste by making surplus food donations faster, smarter, and more efficient.

Restaurants can upload details of surplus food, while NGOs can discover nearby donations and accept pickups before the food goes to waste. Integrated AI analyzes uploaded food images to provide valuable insights such as food type, estimated meals, freshness, and recommended pickup time.
